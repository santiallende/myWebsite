  Single Session
---

Single-session therapy is a focused approach in which we meet with the expectation that one session may be sufficient. Rather than viewing the first meeting as preliminary, the session is treated as a complete and potentially impactful experience in its own right.

People often choose this option when something has come into focus: a decision, a pattern, a loss, or a moment of feeling stuck, and they want to work with it directly. The aim is not simply reflection, but movement: gaining clarity, shifting perspective, or identifying a way forward that feels both meaningful and doable.

In the session, we focus on what matters most right now, drawing on your strengths, past experiences, and capacity for change. The work is active and collaborative, oriented toward creating a shift that can continue after the session ends.

There is no assumption that therapy must continue beyond this meeting. One session may be enough. Each session stands on its own.

Research suggests that a single well-structured session can produce meaningful and lasting change for many people.

My style is warm and direct, with humor as part of the work when it fits naturally. I focus on how past experiences shape the ways we interpret our feelings, relate to others, and make sense of ourselves.
