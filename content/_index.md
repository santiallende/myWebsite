description: Clinical psychologist by training (unlicensed) interested in utilizing clinical trial and intensive longitudinal methodologies to better understand stress responsivity, the placebo response, and the physiological correlates of mind-body practices, including meditation, yoga, whole-body hyperthermia, hypnosis, and floatation-REST. I am passionate about using the R programming language to clean and structure large datasets, develop dashboards, and conduct a variety of analyses, such as linear mixed models, survival models, and mixture models. Another primary interest of mine is to use electronic health record big data analytics to advance a precision medicine approach in mental health care. I have ongoing collaborations with researchers around the world and have been the lead data analyst on a number of publications in psychiatry and the behavioral sciences.
