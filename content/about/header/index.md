  About me
---

I earned my doctorate in Clinical Psychology from the PGSP-Stanford PsyD Consortium and completed my clinical internship at the Sacramento VA Medical Center. I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the War Related Illness and Injury Study Center (WRIISC) at the Palo Alto VA Medical Center and a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine. Currently, in addition to my private practice, I work remotely as a healthcare Data Scientist at WRIISC while residing in Seattle, Washington.

I have worked in a variety of clinical settings with diverse patient populations, utilizing a range of therapeutic modalities, which has shaped my integrative approach. I currently work with adults who wish to explore purpose, meaning, and loss, while also addressing life transitions, chronic stress, burnout, relationship and family dynamics, grief, trauma, serious mental illness, and other emotional challenges. My training in meditation and psychotherapy deepens my ability to integrate mindfulness principles and compassionate awareness into my therapeutic work.

As a researcher, I specialize in biobehavioral health, mind-body interventions, and clinical informatics. My work focuses on analyzing large-scale epidemiological and longitudinal datasets, clinical trial data, and developing clinical dashboards to enhance care delivery, efficiency, and outcomes in large healthcare systems.
