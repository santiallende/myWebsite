  About me
---

I earned my doctorate in Clinical Psychology from the PGSP-Stanford PsyD Consortium and completed my predoctoral clinical internship at the Sacramento VA Medical Center. During my internship, I completed rotations in behavioral medicine, primary care mental health integration, severe mental illness, and general outpatient mental health. I have trained in psychodynamic interventions, reminiscence therapy, narrative therapy, and CBT-based interventions. I have also completed both a 2-year mindfulness meditation teacher certification program and a 9-month meditation and psychotherapy certification program. 

I find that my eclectic clinical experiences provide me with a unique lens from which to approach research projects in healthcare settings. As a postdoc, I am mining electronic health records to better understand areas of improvement in mental health care delivery. The goal of these projects is to use a precision medicine approach to more effectively tailor mental health treatments to diverse patient populations.
