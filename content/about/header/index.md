  About me
---

I earned my doctorate in Clinical Psychology from the PGSP-Stanford PsyD Consortium, completed my clinical internship at the Sacramento VA Medical Center, and a postdoctoral research fellowship at the War Related Illness and Injury Study Center (WRIISC) at the Palo Alto VA Medical Center. I am currently a Data Scientist at WRIISC and a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine. Both positions are remote, as I live in Seattle, Washington.

I have worked with diverse patient populations and with a range of treatment modalities and clinical presentations. I have trained in interpersonal therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, time-limited dynamic psychotherapy, compassion-focused acceptance and commitment therapy, motivational interviewing, narrative therapy, family systems therapies, and reminiscence therapy. I have also completed both a 2-year mindfulness meditation teacher certification program and a 9-month meditation and psychotherapy certification program.

During my internship, I completed rotations in behavioral medicine, primary care mental health integration, severe mental illness, and general outpatient mental health. I received further training in meditation-based interventions, cognitive-behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, attachment-based psychodynamic interventions, and reminiscence therapy. 

I am particularly drawn toward meditation- and depth-oriented therapies and working with adults who are experiencing chronic stress, burnout, adjustment difficulties, relationship and family-of-origin issues, grief and loss, chronic physical health conditions, and interpersonal trauma.

As a researcher, my work is broadly focused on elucidating the mind-body connection in chronic conditions and on evaluating the efficacy of mind-body interventions for stress-related disorders. Two related areas of interest are in mining electronic health records to better understand how mental health interfaces with physical health and improving mental health care delivery in large healthcare systems through the advancement of idiographic and psychoneuroimmunological approaches in precision psychiatry.
