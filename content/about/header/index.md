  About me
---

I earned my doctorate in Clinical Psychology from the PGSP-Stanford PsyD Consortium and completed my predoctoral clinical internship at the Sacramento VA Medical Center. I am now an Associated Health Fellow in the War Related Illness and Injury Study Center (WRIISC) at the Palo Alto VA Medical Center and a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine. 

During my internship, I completed rotations in behavioral medicine, primary care mental health integration, severe mental illness, and general outpatient mental health. I have trained in psychodynamic interventions, narrative therapy, reminiscence therapy, and CBT-based interventions. I have also completed both a 2-year mindfulness meditation teacher certification program and a 9-month meditation and psychotherapy certification program. 

I find that my eclectic clinical experiences provide me with a unique lens from which to approach research projects in healthcare settings. A few of my postdoc projects involve mining electronic health records to better understand areas of improvement in mental health care delivery. The goal of these projects is to use a precision medicine approach to more effectively tailor mental health services to diverse patient populations.
