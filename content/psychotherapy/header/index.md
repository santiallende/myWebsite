# My Approach

I work with adults across the lifespan who experience varying degrees of distress and who would like to cultivate a greater sense of comfort and equanimity in their lives. My style has been described as warm, collaborative, engaging, and humorous. I use a number of approaches to help you become more whole, authentically yourself, and comfortable in your own skin.

As an integrative psychotherapist with an appreciation for the common factors model of psychotherapy, I view the clinical relationship as the vehicle for enduring change. I am deeply committed to co-creating a safe environment where you can explore and integrate various aspects of the Self with acceptance and kindness. Integrating previously neglected, rejected, or betrayed aspects of the Self is associated with improvements in interpersonal relationships and a greater sense of purpose and meaning in life.

I also have a personal meditation practice and find that focused awareness and compassion often make their way into my clinical work and help patients discover a deeper knowing that directs lasting resolution. In addition, I integrate elements from attachment-based psychodynamic interventions, cognitive-behavioral interventions, narrative therapy, and reminiscence therapy into my work with patients. Together, we can draw on a variety of modalities to help you process grief and loss, move into a new stage of life, take on new roles, navigate challenging aspects of relationships, better live with pain, or nurture your capacity for creative and/or spiritual emergence.

Some patients find benefit in using self-report measures and biomarker assessments to support their psychotherapy. If you are interested in using these to better understand yourself, we can determine whether they may be helpful for your growth. I would be happy to discuss this further during our work together.

# Fees and Insurance

My fee is $206 for each 45-minute in-person or telehealth session. I am an out-of-network psychologist but can provide you with a monthly statement to submit to your insurance company for reimbursement. You may call your insurance company to inquire about out-of-network coverage. The procedure code for a 45-minute individual psychotherapy session is 90834.

A few questions to ask your insurance company:

-Do I have out-of-network mental health benefits?

-What is my deductible and has it been met?

-How many sessions per year does my insurance plan cover?

-What is the reimbursement amount per therapy session?

-How do I submit claims from an out-of-network mental health provider?
