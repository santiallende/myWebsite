# My Approach

Sometimes we can sense that something isn't quite right in our lives and it can be somewhat nerve-racking to reach out to a therapist for guidance. With this in mind, I do my best to provide a warm and welcoming environment. I specialize in working with adults who are experiencing the emotional sequelae of chronic stress and burnout, including feeling overwhelmed, depleted and exhausted, pessimistic, detached, anxious, and depressed. Other areas of focus include adjustment difficulties, relationship and family-of-origin issues, grief and loss, chronic physical health conditions, and trauma.

As an integrative psychotherapist with an appreciation for the common factors model of psychotherapy, I view the clinical relationship as the vehicle for enduring change. I help patients increase insight into their relationship patterns and acceptance and compassion toward themselves, others, and the circumstances surrounding them. I find that doing so helps my patients discover novel and creative ways of working with their unique stressors and life circumstances. 

Together, we can discuss emotional themes in your life and help you draw parallels between past and present relationships, cultivate a greater sense of acceptance and self-compassion, explore and change limiting beliefs, and give voice to parts of yourself that feel distant. I integrate elements from mindfulness- and compassion-focused interventions, attachment-based psychodynamic interventions, cognitive-behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, narrative therapy, and reminiscence therapy.

# Fees and Insurance

My standard self-pay fee per 45-minute session is $150.

I am a registered provider in the [Alma](https://helloalma.com) network and hold credentials with Aetna and Optum (UnitedHealthcare, Oscar, and Oxford) insurance carriers. Alma will liaise directly with you concerning eligibility, insurance invoicing, co-payments, and deductible settlements. Information disclosed to Alma will be restricted to that which is essential for payment submission and insurance reimbursement processing. Your session's out-of-pocket expense will be determined by your insurance provider, contingent upon your plan's specifics, in-network deductible status, relevant co-insurance, and/or co-payment amounts.

If I am not in-network with your insurance carrier, I can provide you with a monthly statement to submit to your insurance company for reimbursement. You may call your insurance company to inquire about out-of-network coverage. The procedure code for a 45-minute individual psychotherapy session is 90834.

A few questions to ask your insurance company:

-Do I have out-of-network mental health benefits?

-What is my deductible and has it been met?

-How many sessions per year does my insurance plan cover?

-What is the reimbursement amount per therapy session?

-How do I submit claims from an out-of-network mental health provider?
