# My Approach

Sometimes we can sense that something isn't quite right in our lives and it can be somewhat nerve-racking to reach out to a therapist for guidance. With this in mind, I do my best to provide a warm and welcoming environment. I specialize in working with adults who are experiencing the emotional sequelae of chronic stress and burnout, including feeling overwhelmed, depleted and exhausted, pessimistic, detached, anxious, and depressed. Other areas of focus include adjustment difficulties, relationship and family-of-origin issues, grief and loss, chronic physical health conditions, and trauma.

As an integrative psychotherapist with an appreciation for the common factors model of psychotherapy, I view the clinical relationship as the vehicle for enduring change. I help patients increase insight into their relationship patterns and acceptance and compassion toward themselves, others, and the circumstances surrounding them. I find that doing so helps my patients discover novel and creative ways of working with their unique stressors and life circumstances. 

Together, we can discuss emotional themes in your life and help you draw parallels between past and present relationships, cultivate a greater sense of acceptance and self-compassion, explore and change limiting beliefs, and give voice to parts of yourself that feel distant. I integrate elements from mindfulness- and compassion-focused interventions, attachment-based psychodynamic interventions, cognitive-behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, narrative therapy, and reminiscence therapy.

# Fees and Insurance
My standard self-pay fee per 45-minute session is **$200**. You may click on the blue "Use Your Insurance" button to verify your out-of-network benefits through Reimbursify. This service helps you easily check your insurance coverage for out-of-network providers and submit claims directly to your insurance company for potential reimbursement, all at no expense to you.

Alternatively, I can provide you with a monthly statement that you can submit to your insurance company for reimbursement. You might consider contacting your insurance company to inquire about coverage for out-of-network services. The procedure code for a 45-minute individual psychotherapy session is **90834**.

A few questions to ask your insurance company:

-Do I have out-of-network mental health benefits?

-What is my deductible and has it been met?

-How many sessions per year does my insurance plan cover?

-What is the reimbursement amount per therapy session?

-How do I submit claims from an out-of-network mental health provider?
