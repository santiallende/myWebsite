*Announcement: my practice is full and I am no longer accepting new patients.*

My approach is down-to-earth and steady, with room for humor when it helps. I work with adults who want to explore meaning, purpose, and loss, as well as those navigating life transitions, relationship and family dynamics, chronic stress, burnout, grief, trauma, and other emotional challenges.

I pay close attention to how past experiences shape the ways we interpret our feelings, relate to others, and understand ourselves. Many people carry long-standing beliefs—about who they need to be, what’s expected of them, or which emotions are acceptable—that once served a purpose but no longer reflect how they want to live.

In therapy, we explore these stories and patterns at your pace, creating room for new insight, greater acceptance, and a fuller sense of emotional understanding. Over time, this work can help soften outdated beliefs, strengthen what already serves you, and make space for parts of yourself that may have felt quiet, hidden, or overlooked.

# Fees and Insurance
My standard self-pay fee per 45-minute session is **$200**. 

I am an out-of-network provider. I can provide a monthly statement for you to submit to your insurance company for reimbursement. You may want to call your insurance company to ask about your out-of-network benefits. The procedure code for a 45-minute individual psychotherapy session is **90834**.

A few questions to ask your insurance company:

-Do I have out-of-network mental health benefits?

-What is my deductible and has it been met?

-How many sessions per year does my insurance plan cover?

-What is the reimbursement amount per therapy session?

-How do I submit claims from an out-of-network mental health provider?
