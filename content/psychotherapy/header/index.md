# My Approach

Sometimes we can sense that something isn't quite right in our lives, and it can feel somewhat nerve-racking to reach out to a therapist for guidance. With this in mind, I strive to provide a warm and welcoming environment. I have a particular interest in working with adults who wish to explore purpose, meaning, and loss, while also addressing life transitions, chronic stress, burnout, relationship and family dynamics, grief, trauma, serious mental illness, and other emotional challenges.

As an integrative psychotherapist with an appreciation for the common factors model of psychotherapy, I view the clinical relationship as the vehicle for enduring change. I help clients increase insight into their relationship patterns while fostering acceptance and compassion toward themselves, others, and the circumstances surrounding them. I find that this process helps my clients discover novel and creative ways of working with their unique stressors and life circumstances.

Together, we can explore emotional themes in your life, draw parallels between past and present relationships, cultivate a greater sense of acceptance and self-compassion, challenge limiting beliefs, and give voice to parts of yourself that may feel distant.

# Fees and Insurance
My standard self-pay fee per 45-minute session is **$240**. You may click on the blue "Use Your Insurance" button to verify your out-of-network benefits through Reimbursify. This service helps you easily check your insurance coverage for out-of-network providers and submit claims directly to your insurance company for potential reimbursement, all at no expense to you. I will also provide you with a monthly statement, which you can use with Reimbursify or submit directly to your insurance company for reimbursement. You might also consider contacting your insurance company to inquire about coverage for out-of-network services. The procedure code for a 45-minute individual psychotherapy session is  **90834**.

A few questions to ask your insurance company:

-Do I have out-of-network mental health benefits?

-What is my deductible and has it been met?

-How many sessions per year does my insurance plan cover?

-What is the reimbursement amount per therapy session?

-How do I submit claims from an out-of-network mental health provider?
