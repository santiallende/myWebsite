# My Approach

Sometimes we can sense that something isn't quite right in our lives and it can be somewhat nerve-racking to reach out to a therapist for guidance. With this in mind, I do my best to provide a warm and welcoming environment. In my practice, I specialize in working with young adults, adults, and older adults who are experiencing stress, adjustment issues, relationship issues, anxiety, depression, grief, chronic physical health conditions, interpersonal trauma, and other emotional difficulties.

As an integrative psychotherapist with an appreciation for the common factors model of psychotherapy, I view the clinical relationship as the vehicle for enduring change. I focus on helping patients increase insight into their relationship patterns and increase acceptance and compassion toward themselves, others, and the circumstances surrounding them. I find that this helps my patients discover novel and creative ways of working with their unique challenges. Together, we can discuss emotional themes in your life, draw parallels between past and present relationships, explore and change limiting beliefs, cultivate a greater sense of acceptance and self-compassion, and give voice to parts of yourself that feel distant.

I integrate elements from mindfulness- and compassion-focused interventions, attachment-based psychodynamic interventions, cognitive-behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, narrative therapy, and reminiscence therapy. We can draw on these modalities to help you move into a new stage of life, take on new roles, navigate challenging aspects of relationships, make and maintain healthy lifestyle behavior changes, better live with chronic conditions, process grief and loss, move through trauma, or nurture your capacity for creative and/or spiritual emergence. 

Some patients find benefit in using self-report measures and biomarker feedback (e.g., cortisol, CRP, DHEA) to support their psychotherapy. If you are interested in using these to better understand yourself, we can determine whether they may be helpful for your growth. I would be happy to discuss this further during our work together.

Please note that I am only providing telepsychology services at this time.

# Fees and Insurance

I use a sliding scale model that ranges from \$60 to \$450 per 45-minute telehealth session, depending on need. Rather than asking you for financial documentation, we can simply have a conversation where I will ask, "What are you reasonably able to pay for weekly sessions?"

Please note that I am an out-of-network psychologist but can provide you with a monthly statement to submit to your insurance company for reimbursement. You may call your insurance company to inquire about out-of-network coverage. The procedure code for a 45-minute individual psychotherapy session is 90834.

A few questions to ask your insurance company:

-Do I have out-of-network mental health benefits?

-What is my deductible and has it been met?

-How many sessions per year does my insurance plan cover?

-What is the reimbursement amount per therapy session?

-How do I submit claims from an out-of-network mental health provider?
