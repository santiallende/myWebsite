# My Approach

My approach is down-to-earth, with space for humor when it helps. I have a particular interest in working with adults who wish to explore purpose, meaning, and loss, while also addressing life transitions, relationship and family dynamics, chronic stress, burnout, grief, trauma, and other emotional challenges.

I focus on how past experiences shape the ways we interpret our feelings, relate to others, and make sense of ourselves. Many of us carry long-held beliefs—about who we need to be, what's expected of us, or what emotions are safe to show—that may no longer reflect how we want to live.

In therapy, we'll explore those stories and patterns at your pace, making room for new perspectives, greater acceptance, and a fuller sense of emotional understanding. Over time, this work can help you soften old beliefs that no longer fit, reconnect with your strengths, and make room for parts of yourself that may have felt quiet, hidden, or left out.

# Fees and Insurance
My standard self-pay fee per 45-minute session is **$200**. 

I am an out-of-network provider. I can provide a monthly statement for you to submit to your insurance company for reimbursement. You may want to call your insurance company to ask about your out-of-network benefits. The procedure code for a 45-minute individual psychotherapy session is **90834**.

A few questions to ask your insurance company:

-Do I have out-of-network mental health benefits?

-What is my deductible and has it been met?

-How many sessions per year does my insurance plan cover?

-What is the reimbursement amount per therapy session?

-How do I submit claims from an out-of-network mental health provider?
