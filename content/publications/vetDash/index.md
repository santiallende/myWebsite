**Objectives:** Measurement-based care (MBC) improves clinical decision-making but remains underutilized in the Veterans Health Administration due to barriers such as provider awareness, time constraints, and user-experience limitations. This study describes the development of the War Related Illness and Injury Study Center (WRIISC) Veteran Dashboard (VetDash), a patient-level clinical dashboard designed to integrate the VA’s Collect, Share, Act model into provider workflows.

**Methods:** VetDash was developed using R and Shiny, utilizing data from the WRIISC Clinical Intake Packet Database. It integrates patient-reported health data and military history into a dashboard hosted on a Linux-based Shiny Server within the VA’s intranet.

**Results:**. VetDash includes four modules: Patient Characteristics, Patient Health Symptoms, Patient Exposures, and Patient Self-Report Measures. Providers can visualize patient-reported symptoms, military exposures, and self-report measures, and also compare individual patients to provider-defined cohorts.

**Conclusions:**. VetDash facilitates MBC integration into the clinical workflow, potentially improving patient assessment and personalized care. Future research should evaluate its impact on clinical outcomes and explore further enhancements.
