**Authors:** Santiago Allende, Peter J. Bayley 

**Background:** Chronic psychological stress adversely impacts social, occupational, physical, and mental functioning and has serious implications for the global economy. Indeed, it is well documented that chronic stress-related inflammatory processes have pernicious effects on aging, disease states and progression, and mortality. Prior research has primarily focused on isolated associations between biomarkers of chronic stress, morbidities, and mortality. While critical for advancing the field, these approaches are less sensitive in detecting distinct patterns across multiple biopsychosocial markers important for clinical decision making. Identifying person-level patterns of multiple psychological constructs and inflammatory biomarkers could help to exact prognosis and treatments for chronic stress-related health conditions and reduce their negative socioeconomic consequences.

**Methods:** We obtained data from two cohort studies (Midlife in the United States and Midlife in Japan) of representative adults from the United States (n = 1255; age = 57.32 ± 11.55 years; 57% female) and from Tokyo, Japan (n = 377; age = 55.27 ± 14.03 years; 56% female). We used a latent variable mixture modeling approach to identify subgroups in each cohort based on Interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), evening salivary cortisol/12-hr overnight urinary excretion of cortisol, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and sleep quality. We also examined differences in all-cause mortality among the three derived groups.

**Results:**  Our results supported a three-profile structure in both cohorts: (1) high inflammation and moderate mental health symptoms, (2) high DHEA and poor mental health, and (3) low inflammation and good mental health. After correcting for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni adjustment (individual alpha = .017 for 3 tests), the area between the curves (ABC) of the “Good Mental Health” class and the “High Inflammation” class was significant (ABC = 1.056, se = .24, p < .001) as was the ABC of the “Good Mental Health” class and the “Poor Mental Health” class (ABC = 0.558, se = .165, p < .001). However, the ABC of the “Poor Mental Health” class and the “High Inflammation” class was not significant (ABC = 0.497, se = .250, p = .044, alpha = .017).

**Conclusions:** Data-driven phenotyping of pro-/anti-inflammatory biomarkers, depression, anxiety and sleep quality produced similar subgroups across two culturally diverse populations, suggesting a potential general phenotypic marker of biobehavioral health.
