**Authors:** Santiago Allende, Valerie L. Forman‐Hoffman,  Philippe R. Goldin

**Objective:** This study examined the temporal dynamics of anxiety and depressive symptoms during a 12-week therapist-supported, smartphone-delivered digital health intervention for symptoms of depression and anxiety.

**Methods:** A total of 290 participants were included in the present analyses (age Mean = 39.64, SD = 10.25 years; 79% female; 54% self-reported psychotropic medication use). Linear mixed models were used to examine the concurrent anxiety-depression association and (2) the lead-lag anxiety-depression relationship, with greater anxiety predicted to precede an increase in depression.

**Results:**. In support of Hypothesis 1, greater anxiety during the current biweekly assessment was associated with greater depressive symptoms during the current biweekly assessment. In support of Hypothesis 2, greater anxiety during the prior biweekly assessment was associated with greater depressive symptoms during the current biweekly assessment but not vice-versa.

**Conclusions:**. These findings demonstrate that anxiety and depressive symptoms may overlap and fluctuate in concert, with anxiety symptoms predicting subsequent depressive symptoms but not vice-versa. With sensitivity to study limitations, implications for future intervention designs are discussed.
