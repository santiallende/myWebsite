**Background:** The immuno-regulatory balance between pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokines in youth with mood disorders may be polarized toward greater inflammation, particularly in response to acute psychosocial stressors. Consistent with reports of higher pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokine ratios in youth with symptomatic bipolar disorder (BD), we expected that youth with BD and at high risk for BD (vs. controls) would produce higher pro-/anti-inflammatory ratios in response to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). 

**Methods:** Participants were youth (n = 80; 10-17 y/o; 50% female) with BD, at high risk for BD, and healthy controls. We drew blood at baseline and 15, 30, and 60 minutes after the TSST. Linear mixed models were used to examine between-group differences in three cytokine ratios (IL-6/IL-10, IL1-B/IL-10, or TNFA/IL-10). In exploratory analyses, we used robust regressions to examine whether an increase in anxiety from baseline to 15 minutes post-TSST was associated with higher pro-/anti-inflammatory ratios at 90 minutes post-TSST, and whether diagnostic status moderated these effects. 

**Results:** Although results did not show higher ratios in the BD group or high risk BD group (vs. controls; pâ€™s > .05), exploratory analyses revealed that increased anxiety from baseline to 15 minutes post-TSST predicted higher IL- 6/IL-10 ratios at 90 minutes post-TSST (b = 0.07, se = 0.03, p = .018). Diagnostic status did not moderate this effect (p = .180). 

**Conclusions:** Our results indicate that TSST-induced anxiety in youth is linked to a greater inflammatory response, as evidenced by a greater upregulation of IL-6 compared to IL-10. The IL-6/IL-10 ratio may be a sensitive marker of anxiety during the TSST, irrespective of the presence of a mood disorder in youth. Future studies should investigate whether youth with anxiety demonstrate an imbalance between pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines.
